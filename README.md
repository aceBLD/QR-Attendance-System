# QR Attendy
#### !!PLEASE READ THIS!!
If you are reading this please spare your sanity as i struggle coding this without any knowledge. <br>
This repository is for educational purposes only. I do not intend to release any official software or app. It is not yet secure or safe for public use. I am new to the programming community and hope this is understandable. Its sole purpose is to present the project to my class.

### Introduction
The Secure QR Attendance System also known as QR Attendy is an Web Application that both runs on its Official Website and the Application itself. The main purpose was to provide a quick, accurate, and dependable way to keep track of attendance. By streamlining the process for both students and teachers, it cuts down on manual tasks, minimizes human errors, and neatly organizes data in a secure digital format. Moreover, this system saves time, enhances record management, boosts transparency, and offers a more structured approach to monitoring attendance. The Secure QR Attendance System is likely innovative because it uses QR codes to record attendance quickly, accurately, and securely, improving the traditional process.
